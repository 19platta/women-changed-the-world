        img_path: "./img/Inge_Lehman.jpg",
        bio: "Lehmann was a Danish seismologist. She noticed discrepancies in the seismograph data she was working with, and determined through calculations that the earth must have a solid core, with a molten outer layer. Her models were tested and confirmed by other scientists and proven in the 1970s when technology advanced enough to prove for certain the the earth’s core was solid.\n"

        bio: "Wu was a Chinese physicist best known for the Wu experiment, which proved that parity is not conserved (and her subsequent shun for the Nobel Prize, despite her two colleagues winning it for the same work). This had previously been considered a fundamental physical law, like gravity or conservation of mass. Wu was nicknamed “First Lady of Physics” and “Queen of Nuclear Research”, and compared to Marie Curie for her work."

In typical fashion, her work was undercredited and generally attributed to the men she worked with, she was not invited to speak at conferences. Her colleagues would later attribute the discovery to her, but only in a footnote and often not at all. She died at 50 from breast cancer, but had published about 40 papers before her death. \n"
